  "background": "Current depression diagnosis relies solely on psychiatric evaluations, lacking objective biomarkers, thus this study investigated the potential of blood DNA methylation as a diagnostic tool.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "Blood DNA methylation signatures associated with depression are stable across different populations.",
    "Machine learning and deep learning models can accurately classify depression based on blood DNA methylation profiles.",
    "Different data preprocessing and feature selection strategies significantly impact model performance."
  ],
  "major_findings": [
    "Meta-analysis across eight cohorts identified 1987 CpG sites nominally associated with depression.",
    "Random forest classifiers achieved the highest performance in both cross-validation and hold-out tests, particularly with batch-level processed data.",
    "Harmonized data showed low predictive power, while models with pre-selected features achieved significantly better performance.",
    "Different algorithmic feature selection approaches may outperform limma, but random forest models performed well regardless of the strategy."
