  "background": "Rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs) improve psychiatric disorders by modulating neuroplasticity, neurotransmission, and immunity, potentially through epigenetic processes.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "RAADs' therapeutic effects are causally linked to epigenetic changes.",
    "Epigenetic changes induced by RAADs are cell-type specific.",
    "RAADs directly interact with DNA, histones, or chromatin remodeling complexes.",
    "The optimal dosages and regimens for clinical RAADs applications maximize desirable epigenetic outcomes and minimize undesirable ones."
  ],
  "major_findings": [
    "RAADs, like conventional antidepressants, induce epigenetic changes including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNA regulation in stress-responsive brain regions.",
    "Ketamine reverses stress-induced aberrant DNA methylation, including on the BDNF gene, and restores some stress-induced aberrant histone modifications.",
    "Psychedelics such as LSD and DOI affect DNA methylation and histone acetylation, potentially contributing to their therapeutic effects.",
    "MDMA-assisted psychotherapy leads to peripheral epigenetic changes correlated with therapeutic improvement.",
    "Ayahuasca use is associated with changes in saliva methylation levels and improved mental health outcomes."
  ],
  "null_findings": [
    "Ketamine administration 24 hours after the first dose does not affect whole blood miRNA levels in individuals with treatment-resistant depression.",
    "Ayahuasca did not affect the methylation level of one CpG site within the FKBP5 gene."
  ],
  "new_open_questions": [
    "Do epigenetic changes causally contribute to RAADs' therapeutic effects, or are they a consequence thereof?",
    "What are the precise mechanisms by which RAADs induce epigenetic changes?",
    "What is the cell type-specificity of RAAD-induced epigenetic changes?",
    "How do the effects of RAADs on the epigenome vary with dose, regimen, and individual factors?",
    "What are the long-term effects of RAADs on the epigenome and their clinical implications?"
