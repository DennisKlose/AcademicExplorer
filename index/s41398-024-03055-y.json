  "background": "Rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs) improve psychiatric disorders by modulating neuroplasticity, neurotransmission, and immunity, potentially through epigenetic mechanisms.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "Whether epigenetic changes causally contribute to the therapeutic effects of RAADs, are a consequence thereof, or are unrelated remains unknown.",
    "Psilocybin might increase telomerase activity and telomere length.",
    "Ayahuasca might extinguish the fear response via an epigenetic mechanism mediated by the DMT-activated Sigma-1 receptor.",
    "RAADs might directly interact with DNA, histones, or chromatin remodeling complexes, thus acting as direct epigenetic modulators."
  ],
  "major_findings": [
    "Preliminary evidence indicates that administration of RAADs is accompanied by epigenetic effects which are similar to those elicited by conventional antidepressants.",
    "Ketamine restores some of the stress-induced aberrant DNA methylation, including on the BDNF gene.",
    "Repeated LSD largely increased the methylation level of 635 CpG sites in the PFC of adult male mice.",
    "MDMA-assisted psychotherapy led to peripheral epigenetic changes correlated to therapeutic improvement.",
    "Repeated ketamine during early gestation decreases the cardiac histone H3K9 acetylation level, leading to cardiac enlargement."
