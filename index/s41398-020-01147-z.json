  "background": "Childhood adversity (CA) is a major risk factor for stress-related psychiatric and other medical disorders, and epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may be involved.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "Exposure to CA, cis genotype (G), and their additive and interactive effects contribute to DNA methylation (DNAm) variability.",
    "The proportion of explained variance varies with time to exposure, i.e., effects of CA measured in childhood are qualitatively or quantitatively different than when measured later in life."
  ],
  "major_findings": [
    "For the majority of sites in adult cohorts, DNAm variability was best explained by additive (G+CA) or interactive (G × CA) effects of genotype and CA, but almost never by CA alone.",
    "Across ages and tissues, 1672 DNAm sites showed consistency of the best model in all five cohorts, with G × CA interactions explaining most variance; these sites mapped to genes enriched in brain-specific transcripts and Gene Ontology terms related to development and synaptic function."
  ],
  "null_findings": [
    "CA alone was almost never the strongest driver of DNAm variability; additive or interactive effects of genotype and environment explained DNAm variability best in the majority of CpGs.",
    "No significant tissue-specific enrichments were found for control subsets of genes."
  ],
  "new_open_questions": [
    "Are the identified combined effects of genotype and CA stable across the life course?",
    "What are the specific biological mechanisms underlying the observed G × CA interactions on DNAm?"
