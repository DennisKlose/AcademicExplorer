  "background": "Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur, impacting treatment outcomes, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "Can a common factor characterize the general structure of bridging symptoms in depression-anxiety comorbidity?",
    "Are there neural markers supporting the neurobiological foundation of this common factor?",
    "What connectome-based markers characterize this common factor?",
    "What are the multiscale genetic substrates for these connectome-based markers?"
  ],
  "major_findings": [
    "A common bridging factor (cb factor) was identified from 12 bridging symptoms, predicting comorbidity with robust generalizability.",
    "This cb factor was characterized by connectome patterns in attention and frontoparietal networks, which were moderately heritable.",
    "Genetic connectome-transcriptional markers associated with vasculature and cerebellar development, particularly during late childhood to young adulthood, were identified.",
    "These findings reveal a general factor of bridging symptoms and its neurobiological architectures, enriching neurogenetic understanding of depression-anxiety comorbidity."
