  "major_findings": [
    "Early life experiences, such as maternal care, significantly influence OXTRm in both animal models and humans.",
    "OXTRm is highly variable across individuals and is associated with differences in social behavior and psychopathology.",
    "Specific CpG sites within the OXTR promoter region are functionally related to OXTR expression and are consistently associated with behavioral outcomes across species.",
    "OXTRm may impact additional cellular mechanisms, such as the perinatal GABA switch, with therapeutic potential.",
    "Early life therapies targeting OXTRm may improve the therapeutic potential of exogenous oxytocin."
