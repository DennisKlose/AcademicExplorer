    "Composite prenatal and postnatal adversity scores identified additional CpG sites associated with differential DNA methylation, suggesting a cumulative effect of maternal mental health on the infant epigenome.",
    "Several associated genes (PLAGL1, HYMAI, BRD2, and ERC2) have been implicated in adverse fetal outcomes and neuropsychiatric disorders."
