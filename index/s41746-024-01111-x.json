    "CosinorAge, a digital biomarker derived from wearable-based circadian rhythmicity, reflects biological aging and predicts mortality, morbidity, and age-related functional decline.",
    "Integrating circadian rhythmicity enhances the prediction of biological aging compared to physical activity alone."
  ],
  "major_findings": [
    "A one-year increase in CosinorAge corresponded to 8-12% higher all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks and 3-14% increased prospective incidences of age-related diseases.",
    "CosinorAge captured a non-linear decline in resilience and physical functioning, evidenced by an 8â€“33% reduction in self-rated health and a 3-23% decline in health-related quality of life.",
    "Young and fast agers showed a substantially delayed acrophase compared to slow agers, with the difference diminishing in older adults.",
    "Integrating circadian rhythmicity significantly enhanced the predictive performance of biological aging compared to physical activity alone."
