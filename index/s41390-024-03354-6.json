  "background": "Adults born preterm at very low birth weight have increased risks for various health conditions, potentially mediated by epigenetic regulation.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "There are blood DNAm differences between young adults born preterm at VLBW and term controls.",
    "Some of these differences may be seen in unrelated cohorts of varying ages when investigating birth weight as the exposure.",
    "Some of the differences in DNAm may be related to secondary birth exposures."

  "major_findings": [
    "Sixty-six CpG sites were differentially methylated between VLBW adults and controls in the discovery cohort.",
    "Five CpG sites near GLI2 were hypermethylated in VLBW individuals and associated with lower birth weight in a meta-analysis of four independent cohorts.",
    "Exploratory analyses in two additional cohorts revealed that 41 CpGs were differentially methylated with secondary exposures (preterm birth, SGA, gestational age, birth weight SD)."
