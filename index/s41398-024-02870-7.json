  "background": "Excessive and persistent aggressiveness is a common behavioral problem in children, and while half of the variance is attributed to genetic factors, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "To provide an overview of studies examining the genetics of childhood aggression irrespective of psychiatric diagnosis.",
    "To understand the genetic underpinnings of childhood aggression."

  "major_findings": [
    "Candidate gene studies, particularly of MAOA, DRD4, and COMT, continue to dominate the field, but genome-wide association and epigenetic studies are increasing.",
    "Published studies tend to be moderate in size, with variable methods of assessing aggressive behavior and inconsistent categorizations of tandem repeat variants, leading to inconclusive findings on genetic main effects, gene-gene, and gene-environment interactions.",
    "The majority of studies are conducted on European, male-only, or male-female mixed participants.",
    "Genetic factors account for roughly 50-65% of the risk of high aggression."
  ],
  "null_findings": [
    "Many candidate gene studies did not find significant associations between specific genes and childhood aggression.",
    "Genome-wide association studies did not identify genome-wide significant SNPs for aggression in several studies."

    "What are the biological mechanisms underlying child aggression?",
