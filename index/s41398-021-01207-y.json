  "major_findings": [
    "Childhood maltreatment is associated with altered DNA methylation in both children and adults.",
    "Consistent findings across multiple studies show that childhood maltreatment is associated with altered methylation of genes that regulate glucocorticoid signaling, including NR3C1 and FKBP5.",
